      <description>Before here was my rambling about how google and other search engines are not indexing this site. But I wrote that I did my initial research. But now I did a deep dive into all SEO stuff and found that the theme that I use had a metatag
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;#34;robots&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;noindex, nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;gt; and required special configuration for it to change to &amp;lsquo;index, follow&amp;rsquo;. So I will change it today and see give it more time for search engines to catch up.</description>

      <description>tldr: Swing VPN is using its user base to DDOS sites using its users as a an attack botnet.
Introduction It all started with a friend of mine complaining that his phone was doing a request to a specific app every few seconds. Initial assumption was that the phone was infected with a virus but a 2 minute investigation showed that all requests went from &amp;lsquo;Swing VPN&amp;rsquo; app which were legitimately installed on the phone as VPN service.</description>
