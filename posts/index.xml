      <description>tldr: Swing VPN is using its user base to DDOS sites using its users as a an attack botnet.

Initial assumption was that the phone was infected with a virus but a 2 minute investigation showed that all requests went from &amp;lsquo;Swing VPN&amp;rsquo; app which were legitimately installed on the phone as VPN service.</description>
