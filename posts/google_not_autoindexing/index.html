<p>So currently it looks like that it was me who messed up. If you are currious
abotu what was written here before, you can go into git log.</p>
<h3 id="hugo">Hugo</h3>
<p>For my current setup I use Hugo as a static site builder. And the theme that I
use has a setting which puts &rsquo;nofollow&rsquo; if the site is not in production. And
of course I did a mistake. So in case you are also using hugo and google search
is important for youu then don&rsquo;t forget to check your site for these types of
silly errors.</p>
